    set(CopperSpice "Z:/Projects2022/copperspice/vs2022")

### Introduction

CopperSpice is a set of individual libraries which can be used to develop cross platform software
applications in C++. It is a totally open source project released under the LGPL V2.1 license and was
initially derived from the Qt framework. Over the last several years CopperSpice has completely diverged,
with a goal of providing a first class GUI library to unite the C++ community.

The libraries available in CopperSpice include:

 * CsCore
 * CsGui
 * CsMultimedia
 * CsNetwork
 * CsOpenGL
 * CsScript
 * CsSql
 * CsSvg
 * CsWebKit
 * CsXml
 * CsXmlPatterns

There are also several open source BSD licensed libraries which are used by CopperSpice and available as stand
alone libraries for anyone developing C++ applications.

 * CsCrypto
 * CsLibGuarded
 * CsPrint
 * CsSignal
 * CsString

The CopperSpice Overview documentation includes information on building CopperSpice, downloading prebuilt binary
files, package requirements, setting up an application which links with CopperSpice, migrating to CopperSpice, and
general configuration information.
